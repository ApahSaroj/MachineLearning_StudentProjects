#### About the Course

*You will learn the theory and practice of data analytics and machine learning for subsurface resource modeling. We will build from the ground up covering fundamental probability and statistics; data preparation and feature engineering, inference (clustering, multidimensional scaling) and prediction (regression, naïve Bayes, decision trees, random forest, support vector machines and artificial neural nets); model selection, training, testing, tuning and validation.*

You don't have to take my word for it! All of the lectures are recorded on my YouTube Channel. [Subsurface Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG19vXLQHvSC2ZKFIkgVpI9fCjkN38kwf).


#### About the Graduate Projects

The graduate students in my Subsurface Machine Learning Course complete a Machine Learning project that they have agreed to share in this GitHub repository. Here's the criteria for the projects.

| Element                | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Great Executive Summary | Gap, Work to Address Gap, Learnings and Recommendation |
| Workflow Steps          |  All Aligned with Goal                                                                                                    |
| Concise Workflow        | Every Step and Figure has a Purpose / Consistent with Provided Template / Features Briefly Explained / Feature have Units |
| Images / Figures         | Excellent Figures / Subplots and Combined Plots for Efficient Displays and Communication / Axes Labeled / Consistent Figure Sizes |
| Demonstrated Knowledge  | All Modeling Choices Defended / Demonstrated Extension of Knowledge                                                               | 
| Readable Code           | Code Documentation / Steps’ Description and Observations between Code Blocks / Only Include Needed Packages / Use Function for Concise Code |
| Citations               | All Code from Others Cited                                                                                                        |
| Creativity / Innovation | Unique, Novel Application of Machine Learning                                                                                     |

I share these to promote the students' work. 

* We are teaching novel data analytics, geostatistics and machine learning skills to engineering and science students.


#### Want to Work Together?

I hope this content is helpful to those that want to learn more about subsurface modeling, data analytics and machine learning. Students and working professionals are welcome to participate.

* Want to invite me to visit your company for training, mentoring, project review, workflow design and / or consulting? I'd be happy to drop by and work with you! 

* Interested in partnering, supporting my graduate student research or my Subsurface Data Analytics and Machine Learning consortium (co-PIs including Profs. Foster, Torres-Verdin and van Oort)? My research combines data analytics, stochastic modeling and machine learning theory with practice to develop novel methods and workflows to add value. We are solving challenging subsurface problems!

* I can be reached at mpyrcz@austin.utexas.edu.

I'm always happy to discuss,

*Michael*
